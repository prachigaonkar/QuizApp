# 🎯 QuizApp

QuizApp is a **ReactJS-based** web application that allows users to take assessments by solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application ensures a seamless user experience with **validations, scoring, and a final result display**.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Interactive Quiz:** Users can solve MCQs one question at a time.
✅ **Option Selection Validation:** Users cannot proceed to the next question without selecting an option.
✅ **Dynamic Scoring:** Scores are calculated in real-time using a score state variable.
✅ **Final Score Display:** Once all questions are answered, users are presented with their final score.
✅ **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for taking quizzes.

## 🚀 How It Works
### 1️⃣ Start the Quiz:
- The quiz begins with the first question displayed on the screen.

### 2️⃣ Option Selection:
- Users must select an option to enable the **"Next"** button.
- If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.

### 3️⃣ Score Calculation:
- The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options.

### 4️⃣ Final Score:
- Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **ReactJS**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- 🎯 **State Management**: Managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
